## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

Updated and continued use of JavaScript functions and for loops in order to randomly generate passwords for user after meeting criteria set by user
through the completion of yes/no input to determine whether or not the new password will contain uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters.
